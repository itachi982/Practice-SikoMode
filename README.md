Title: SikoMode Malware Analysis Report.

Description:

This GitHub repository contains my report on my initial experience with malware analysis. I am going to dive deep into the world of malicious software to better understand its techniques and share valuable insights with the cybersecurity community.

Inside this repository, you'll find a detailed report outlining my step-by-step approach to analyzing malware samples. I cover static and dynamic analysis, behavioral analysis, code reverse-engineering, and identifying indicators of malware. By using these methods, I aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the malware functions, behaves, and impacts targeted systems.

This report serves as a resource for those interested in learning the basics of malware analysis and highlights my own learning journey. I encourage collaboration, feedback, and discussions from fellow analysts and researchers to strengthen our collective knowledge.

Feel free to explore the report, share your thoughts, and join the conversation.
